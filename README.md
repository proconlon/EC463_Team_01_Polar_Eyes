## Project Overview
We plan to develop a fully enclosed and weather safe unit that is easily reproducible into multiple units for remote polar observation across multiple remote sites. We want to deliver two 360 degree cameras with video capability with one above the ice surface and one hung below a drilled hole into the water below the ice. For that reason, the unit needs to be weather resistant to extreme cold and darkness while also preventing ice melt.
