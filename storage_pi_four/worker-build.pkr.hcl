// This file is the "recipe" for Packer to build our bootable SD card image.
// It tells Packer to:
// 1. Start with a specific, "frozen" RPi OS Lite image.
// 2. Copy our entire project repo into the image.
// 3. Run our 'setup_worker.sh' script inside the image to install/compile everything.
// 4. Save the result as a new .img file.
